# UTImodel -  Hybrid Cellular Automaton Model to study recurrent UTIs in the bladder

This repository contains the computational implementation of the model communicated in our recently submitted manuscript "A Hybrid Individual-based Mathematical Model to study Bladder Infections"

# Caveats and Disclaimers
A newer version of this code, which is more user and developer friendly, is currently being developed. Therefore, this repository will likely become deprecated in the future. Furthermore, the code is intended solely for research purposes, and cannot be used in any other way.

# Compilation

## Pre-requisites
The code has hard dependencies on YAML-cpp and the GNU Scientific Library, which will need to be installed prior to compilation.
## Linux and MacOS X
To compile the code, simply issue the following command in a terminal:
c++ -g -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lyaml-cpp -std=c++11 -lstdc++fs UTImodel.cpp Agent.cpp Environment.cpp Location.cpp Parameters.cpp
## Usage 
To run the code, simply enter the following command in a terminal:
./a.out \<YAML input File\>
where <YAML Input File> denotes the path to the YAML input file (examples of which can be found in the data repository for our manuscript)
  
# Visualisation
 To plot the output generated by the code, we recommend using the Python plotting scripts available in the data repository for our manuscript. Note that the plotting scripts have dependencies on the Python packages: numpy and matplotlib.
